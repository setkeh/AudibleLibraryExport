# AudibleLibraryExport
A tool to export Audible Library Titles

 How to use.
 Log on to Audible.com, and open up your library.
 It can be a good idea to increase the number of items per page
 and the time period you look back.


 Next, you want to run this entire file as a script on the page.
 Chrome, Firefox and Internet Explorer does this differently.
 For chrome, press F12 to open the Chrome Dev Tools, and click
 on the Console. Then paste in this whole file in the console
 window and press enter.


You can now copy and Paste the Table Data into somthing like google sheets/docs and share it with your Friends.


 This Script will likely only work on https://www.audible.com.au and https://www.audible.com
